    <para id="id1171969513195"><title>Change of Pace:</title>
    Find alternate places to work besides your home, office, and lab. Look for internet cafes or a park with great picnic tables, etc. </para>

    Educate family, friends, significant others, and students about your job and your work style. Some may not entirely understand academia or the tenure process or how you in particular are working toward your goals. These people play a very important role in balancing your life so it really helps to have them fully on board!</para>
